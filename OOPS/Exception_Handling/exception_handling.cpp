/*
Exception Handling:

    - This helps to avoid the program crash due to a segment of code in the program
    - Exception handling allows to manage the segments of program which may lead to errors in runtime
    and avoiding the program crash by handling the errors in runtime.

    try: represents a block of code that can throw an exception.

    catch: represents a block of code that is executed when a particular exception is thrown.
    
    throw: Used to throw an exception. Also used to list the exceptions that a function throws, but doesnâ€™t handle itself.
